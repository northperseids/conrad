Conrad is a dictionary lookup Discord bot intended for conlangers (people who create languages).

Conrad allows users to link up to three publicly-visible Google spreadsheets containing a dictionary of their languages and ask Conrad to look up definitions from those linked sheets.

Users can also share spreadsheet IDs and conlang names with others, allowing friends or other people access to a conlang dictionary without having to share the original Google spreadsheet.

Conrad is still in development. If you'd like access or to trial the bot, or to get updates on progress, please join the support server at https://discord.gg/ZAdZEmM6DW.
